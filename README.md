After few questions, you can start with the game.

The board is always displayed with the coordinate headers which can help you to orient yourself.

You can choose your next move specifying the coordinates of it with a pair (x y): x for the coordinate on the abscissa axis (horizontal), y for the one on the ordinate axis (vertical).

You can specify the coordinates using any kind of separator:

```
- "0 0"   -> (0 0)
- "2,1"   -> (2 1)
- "1, 0"  -> (1 0)
- "0-2"   -> (0 2)
- "20"    -> (2 0) [also with no separator]
- "1"     -> (1 1) [nice trick for twin pairs ;)]
```

On the board you're always marked as the **X** and the computer as the **O**.
