##How to play
![the start](http://i61.tinypic.com/35hi9ns.png)

After few questions, you can start with the game.

The board is always displayed with the coordinate headers which can help you to orient yourself.

You can choose your next move specifying the coordinates of it with a pair **(x y)**: **x** for the coordinate on the abscissa axis (horizontal), **y** for the one on the ordinate axis (vertical).

On the board the player who starts is always marked as **X**; the second player as **O**.

You can specify the coordinates using any kind of separator:

```
- "0 0"   -> (0 0)
- "2,1"   -> (2 1)
- "1, 0"  -> (1 0)
- "0-2"   -> (0 2)
- "20"    -> (2 0) [also with no separator]
- "1"     -> (1 1) [nice trick for twin pairs ;)]
```
